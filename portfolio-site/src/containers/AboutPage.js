                <p>As a neuroscience graduate trying to walk the line between art and science, I have always had an interest in human-machine interactions, so I decided to pursue a full-stack developer role through the program at Flatiron School. The skills Iâ€™ve acquired  include: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML/CSS, and GIt/Github, PostgreSQL. My goal is to build applications that improve, inspire, and integrate with living in the 21st century.</p>
